# BeanCount
Given the bean length, height, and jar size, we find the number of beans placed in the jar
After having done exhaustive research we have a loadfactor = 74.5%, where only this much percentage of jelly beans can be loaded in jar 
We consider the jelly bean volume= (5*pi*beanLength*beanHeight^2)/24
Then we come up with the total number of jellybeans in jar using the formula=>>> VolumeOfJar(given)*LOADFACTOR/VolumeOfSingleBean
